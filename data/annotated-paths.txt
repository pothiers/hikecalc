# This is an annotated data file that can be loaded by HikeCalc.
# We refer to this as the "Distance List" format.
#
# This data is for the Catalina Mtns (North of Tucson, Az)
#
# The hash symbol ("#") is the comment character.  Everything after
# the comment character on a line is ignored. Blank lines are
# ignored.  Successive white-space characters (blank, tab, new-line)
# are treated as a single white-space character and used to seperate
# items.
#
# Line starts with NUMBER or WAYPOINT
# NUMBER:: distance from previous WAYPOINT
# WAYPOINT:: Unique name (per file). First char is alpha. 
#            Consists of letters, numbers, "@", and "_" only.
# 
# Two adjacent WAYPOINTS means break in trail. 
# A WAYPOINT can be follow by a LONG-NAME using the format:
#   WAYPOINT="long name is any text between quotes"
# e.g.
#   SabinoTH="Sabino Visitors Center"
# A LONG-NAME can NOT span lines.
#
#
# Nameing conventions used in this file:
#   TE:: Trail End (opposite of TS)
#   TS:: Trail Start (opposite of TE); like TH, but less so.
#   TH:: Trail Head; as given by map where available, else logical start
#        If you had to walk to get here, its a "TS". 
#   For the purposes of this file, starts that you can DRIVE to are "TH". 
#   Places the Sabino Shuttle takes you (but you aren't allowed to drive) 
#   are NOT "TH"
