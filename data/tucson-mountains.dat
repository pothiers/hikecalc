# "trail" or "path" format
#
# Line starts with NUMBER or WAYPOINT
# NUMBER:: distance from previous WAYPOINT
# WAYPOINT:: Unique name (per file). First char is alpha
# 
# Each seperated by white space.  
# Two adjacent WAYPOINTS means break in trail. 
#
# Nameing conventions:
#   TE:: Trail End (opposite of TS)
#   TS:: Trail Start (opposite of TE); like TH, but less so.
#   TH:: Trail Head; as given by map where available, else logical start
#        If you had to walk to get here, its a "TS".
